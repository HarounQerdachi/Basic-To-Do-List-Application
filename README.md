# Basic-To-Do-List-Application

## Project Description:

This Python project is a basic to-do list application that allows users to manage their tasks. It utilizes various fundamental Python data types and programming constructs:

- Integers: Integers can be used to represent options for different menu choices or to index tasks in the to-do list.

- Strings: Strings are used to represent task names and messages displayed to the user.

- Lists: Lists are employed to store and display tasks in the to-do list. You can use lists to store and organize multiple tasks.

- Sets: Sets are used to ensure that each task in the to-do list is unique. Sets are particularly useful when you want to avoid duplicate tasks.

- Functions: Functions are defined to encapsulate different operations within the to-do list application, such as adding tasks, viewing tasks, removing tasks, and quitting the application. Functions help in organizing and reusing code.

- Loops: The main program loop is implemented using a while loop. This loop continually presents a menu of options to the user and executes the selected option until the user decides to quit the application.

## Key Features:

- Add a Task: Users can add new tasks to the to-do list. The application ensures that each task is unique by using a set to store tasks.

- View Tasks: Users can view all the tasks currently in their to-do list. If the list is empty, a message informs the user.

- Remove a Task: Users can remove a specific task from their to-do list. If the task is not found, the application provides feedback.

- Quit: Users can exit the application when they are done managing their tasks.
